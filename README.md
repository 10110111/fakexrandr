FakeXRandR
==========

This is a tool to cheat an X11 server to believe that there are more monitors
than there actually are. It hooks into libXRandR and libXinerama and replaces
certain, configurable monitor configurations with multiple virtual monitors. A
tool that comes with this package can be used to configure how monitors are
split.

This tool used to only work with XRandR, but I found it useful to add Xinerama
emulation. It can be readily removed if it isn't needed though.

Use cases
---------

You'll want to use this library if you have a multi-head setup, but a crappy
video driver which tells RandR that there is only one big monitor, resulting in
wrong window placement by window managers. Matrox Tripple Head 2 Go et al. are
other candidates, where there really is only one big monitor, but you'd want to
split it anyway.

Installation
------------

In most cases, simply run `make`, then install using `make install`. This will determine
where the library should be installed and where the originals reside. Pay
attention to any warnings/errors from the configure script. To compile the
library, you will need the XRandR and X11 development packages for your
distribution.

After installation, use the `fakexrandr-manage` tool to create a configuration (in
`~/.config/fakexrandr.bin`).

For **Arch Linux**, there is a [PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fakexrandr-git/)
([git](https://github.com/pschmitt/aur-fakexrandr-git)) by
[Philipp Schmitt](https://github.com/pschmitt).

Manual installation
-------------------

If you need FakeXRandR for another use case or the automated building does not
work for you, here are some details:

The `configure` script creates a `config.h` header with the
path to the system's real `libXrandr.so` file and a path which preceeds that of
the real library in the ld search path, where the FakeXRandR should be placed.
You can use `ldconfig -v` to get a list of suitable directories, if `configure`
should fail to determine one.

The `libXrandr.c` file only contains a initialization function which loads the
symbols from the real library and implementations of the functions that we
actually override and which require more than replacement of XIDs for fake
screens with real the one's. All other functions are automatically generated
by `make_skeleton.py` from the default Xrandr header file.

How to
------

After installation, you have a tool `fakexrandr-manage` available. Use the
select box at the top to choose an output that you want to split and click
"Create". It will be identified by its resolution and EDID, which is a device
specific identifier. A monitor will be drawn below. You can add splits by
drawing horizontal and vertical lines with your mouse. You can move existing
lines with the left mouse button, and remove them by right-clicking. When you
close the configuration tool, you will be asked whether you want to save the
altered configuration. Other programs, including your window manager, might
need to be restarted before they begin to use the new configuration.

FAQ
---

* **How can I see if it's working?**<br/>
  Run `ldd xrandr`. `libXrandr.so` should show up in `/usr/local/lib`. Then,
  start `xrandr`. Any split screens should show up multiple times, with `~1`,
  `~2`, etc. appended to their names.  After you restarted your X11 session,
  fullscreening applications using Xrandr (e.g. GTK apps) should fullscreen to
  the virtual screen, not the physical one.
* **Changing settings of the fake screen doesn't have any effect?!**<br/>
  XRandR is only used to *communicate* information on the resolution and output
  settings between X11 server, graphics driver and applications. It is up to
  the graphics driver to actually *apply* any settings. Since FakeXRandR
  only hooks into the X11 â†” application communication, attempts to change
  settings for fake screens won't have any effect.
* **My two screens are mirrored. Does this library help?**<br/>
  No. See the FAQ in the Gist for FakeXinerama (see "See also" section).

TODO
----

* The program currently relies on the OS caching the configuration file in system
  memory. Since many programs will read it often, it would be useful to cache
  it ourselfes, in XResources (see an old revision for some Python code in the
  management tool regarding that), via a daemon, or shared memory.
